  <h1><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 8 January, 2026</p>

  <p>
    Quantum Blocks is a mobile game provided by MxD Studio (the “Developer”). Quantum Blocks offers gameplay, features,
    content, and related services through mobile applications and other distribution channels or platforms (collectively,
    the “Services”).
  </p>

  <p>
    These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Services and form a legally binding
    agreement between you and us.
  </p>

  <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.</strong></p>

  <p>
    By installing, using, or otherwise accessing the Services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to
    be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice by updating the
    “Last Updated” date and/or providing additional notice within the Services where reasonable. Your continued use of the
    Services after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. APPLICATION AND SCOPE</h2>

  <p class="small-gap">We may provide the following Services, depending on the version of the app and your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Quantum Blocks game and gameplay features;</li>

    <li>Customer support;</li>
    <li>Other features or services we may add from time to time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some features may be available free of charge, and some may be offered for a fee (such as ad-free options or other
    in-app purchases, if available).
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 ELIGIBILITY FOR USING THE SERVICES</h3>

  <p>
    The Services may be available to users of different age groups. If you are under 13, you may not use the Services
    unless permitted by applicable law in your country and, where required, with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are aged 13–17 (or under the age of legal majority where you live), you confirm that you have permission from
    a parent or legal guardian to use the Services and to make any purchases (if applicable).
  </p>

  <p>
    If a parent or legal guardian believes the Services are not appropriate for a child, please contact us at:
    <a href="mailto:blocksquantum@gmail.com">blocksquantum@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 LIMITED LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS</h3>

  <p>
    Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
    revocable license to access and use the Services solely for your personal, non-commercial entertainment purposes.
  </p>

  <p>No ownership rights are transferred to you. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by us and our licensors.</p>

  <p class="small-gap">You agree that you will not, and will not attempt to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Services for commercial purposes (including advertising, solicitation, spam, or chain messages);</li>
    <li>
      Copy, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise exploit any part of the Services
      except as permitted by law;
    </li>
    <li>
      Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, or create derivative works from the Services, except
      to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law;
    </li>
    <li>
      Interfere with or disrupt the Services, servers, or networks, including via malware, automated scraping, or
      denial-of-service attempts;
    </li>
    <li>Bypass or attempt to bypass security or access controls;</li>
    <li>Use the Services in a manner that violates applicable laws or infringes others’ rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. USER ACCOUNTS (IF APPLICABLE)</h2>

  <p>
    Quantum Blocks may allow sign-in to the Services or connectivity via third-party services (for example, Google Play
    Games or a Google account), depending on the version you use.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you use a third-party account or service, your use is also governed by that third party’s terms and policies, and
    you are responsible for complying with them. We are not responsible for third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>3. PURCHASES AND REFUNDS (IF APPLICABLE)</h2>

  <p>
    Certain functions or features may be offered for purchase (such as removing ads, subscriptions, or in-game items),
    depending on availability.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Purchases are processed by the app marketplace (e.g., Google Play) and are subject to its payment terms and procedures.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your marketplace credentials and for complying with the marketplace rules.</li>
    <li>If you are a minor, you must not make purchases without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Refunds are generally handled by the app marketplace under its policies. If you believe exceptional circumstances
    apply, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:blocksquantum@gmail.com">blocksquantum@gmail.com</a> and we will review your
    request, but we cannot guarantee refunds because marketplace rules may control the outcome.
  </p>

  <h2>4. USER CONDUCT</h2>

  <p>You must use the Services lawfully and responsibly. You must not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interfere with, damage, or disrupt any part of the Services;</li>
    <li>Upload or transmit viruses, harmful code, or malicious content;</li>
    <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts, devices, or networks;</li>
    <li>Copy, reproduce, sell, or exploit the Services outside what is allowed by law;</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer or extract data from the Services beyond permitted uses;</li>
    <li>Infringe intellectual property rights or other legitimate rights of any person.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. THIRD-PARTY LINKS, ADS, AND SERVICES</h2>

  <p>The Services may include third-party services, including advertising.</p>

  <p>
    In particular, Quantum Blocks uses Google AdMob (or other Google advertising technologies) to display ads. Third
    parties may collect and use information (such as device identifiers, approximate location, and interaction data) to
    provide, measure, and personalize ads, subject to their own terms and policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Third-party websites, plug-ins, SDKs, and services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We do not
    control, endorse, or assume responsibility for third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>

  <p>
    All intellectual property rights related to the Services—such as trademarks, logos, artwork, graphics, text, software,
    source code, algorithms, databases, and other content—are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by applicable
    laws and international treaties.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may not use our intellectual property without our prior written permission except as expressly allowed in these
    Terms or by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

  <p><strong>YOU USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong></p>

  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
      including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    </li>
    <li>We do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or secure operation of the Services.</li>
    <li>
      We are not responsible for losses or damages arising from: (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) use of the Services
      in a manner not intended; (iii) actions or failures of third parties (including ad providers, marketplaces, and
      network providers); or (iv) events outside our reasonable control (including internet outages, force majeure,
      cyberattacks, malware, or platform failures).
    </li>
    <li>
      In no event will we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If applicable law does not allow certain limitations, some limitations may not apply to you. In any case, our total
    liability will be limited to the amount you paid to us (if any) for the Services in the 6 months preceding the event
    giving rise to the claim, or the minimum amount permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>8. PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION</h2>

  <p>
    We value privacy and take reasonable measures to protect information we process. The Services may involve data
    processing by third parties (such as ad networks and app marketplaces).
  </p>

  <p>
    If we provide a separate Privacy Policy for Quantum Blocks, it will be made available within the app and/or on the
    store listing or other channel where the app is distributed, and it forms part of your understanding of how data is
    handled.
  </p>

  <h2>9. INDEMNITY</h2>

  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and any affiliates or
    partners from and against claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising
    out of or relating to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your breach of these Terms;</li>
    <li>Your misuse of the Services;</li>
    <li>Your violation of any law or third-party rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. TERMINATION</h2>

  <p>You may stop using the Services at any time.</p>

  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services (or parts of them) if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You breach these Terms;</li>
    <li>The Services are discontinued or no longer offered to users;</li>
    <li>
      We reasonably believe suspension or termination is necessary to protect the Services, other users, or to comply with
      legal obligations.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including Intellectual Property, Disclaimer, Limitation of
    Liability, Indemnity, Governing Law, and Miscellaneous) will survive.
  </p>

  <h2>11. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

  <p>
    These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Romania and applicable European Union law,
    without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:blocksquantum@gmail.com">blocksquantum@gmail.com</a> and we will
    try to resolve disputes informally.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a resident of the European Union and you act as a consumer, you may have mandatory rights under the laws of
    your country of residence, and you may bring claims before the competent courts in your country, as required by
    applicable consumer protection laws.
  </p>

  <h2>12. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.</li>
    <li>
      If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, and the unenforceable
      provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We
      may assign these Terms as part of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law.
    </li>
    <li>Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement.</li>
  </ul>
